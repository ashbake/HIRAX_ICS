## take guide images 
## locate star offset
## trasnalte to arc 
## send to telescope
#
# setup:
# - guide data folder set to current date
# - code checks this folder for new data
# - reference location hard coded for now, but ref first image
#
# how sequence goes:
# 
#  - check for new file in guide folder
#  - if new file, open it
#  - process file through source finder
#  - calculate offset funciton
#  - convert offset to arcsec
#  - save result to TCS format?

    i think that (x) down (in default python plot of guide image) is down so positive 
    dx is west and positive dy is south --> flip signs. x and y are good

    test this ultimately bc not sure if "positive values move east and north" means
    the stars or the telescope. probs the telescope wich would make sign flight correct
